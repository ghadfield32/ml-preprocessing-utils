Below is a sample **README.md** you can place in your **examples** folder to guide users on how to run and interpret the **datapreprocessor_mod_nb.ipynb** notebook. This README explains the purpose of the example notebook, how to set it up, and what to expect when running it. 

```markdown
# Example: Using `datapreprocessor_mod_nb.ipynb`

This folder contains an example Jupyter notebook, **`datapreprocessor_mod_nb.ipynb`**, showcasing how to use the **DataPreprocessor** class to prepare datasets for machine learning workflows. You can explore the notebook to understand the preprocessing steps, including:

1. **Splitting** data into train and test sets  
2. **Handling missing values** for both numerical and categorical features  
3. **Detecting and handling outliers**  
4. **Encoding** categorical features  
5. **Scaling** numerical features  
6. **Applying SMOTE** to address class imbalance  
7. **Building a preprocessing pipeline** and **saving/loading** transformers  
8. **Inverse transforming** the preprocessed data for interpretability

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.6+**  
   Make sure you have a compatible Python environment. 

2. **Dependencies Installed**  
   You’ll need the libraries used in this example, such as:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `imblearn`
   - `pyyaml`
   - `joblib`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
   
   You can install them (and any others) by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or by installing the main package with
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
   from your project’s root directory (assuming the `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` includes these dependencies).

3. **Jupyter Notebook**  
   If you don’t already have Jupyter installed, install it via:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
   Then, you can launch the notebook interface:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

---

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Notebook**  
   From this `examples` directory (or project root), launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Once the interface opens, navigate to and open **`datapreprocessor_mod_nb.ipynb`**.

2. **Review the Code**  
   The notebook starts by importing `DataPreprocessor` and other necessary modules. It then demonstrates how to configure and initialize the **DataPreprocessor** for different machine learning tasks (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).

3. **Load Your Own Data**  
   - By default, the example code references CSV files or a local dataset path.  
   - Modify the path inside the notebook to point to your dataset(s).  
   - Make sure you adjust the feature lists (numerical, nominal, ordinal, etc.) to match your own data columns.

4. **Run Each Cell**  
   - Step through each cell in sequence to see the transformations and output logs.  
   - Debug and normality testing steps can be toggled on or off via the `options` dictionary or the class’s debug flags.

5. **Inspect the Results**  
   - You’ll see how missing values, outliers, and encodings are handled.  
   - View the “recommendations” DataFrame for a summary of what was done to each feature.  
   - Check the *inverse-transformed* data to see how the preprocessed features map back to original values.

## Notebook Outline

1. **Initialization**  
   Sets up logging, paths, and loads the configuration if applicable.

2. **Data Loading**  
   Demonstrates how to load a dataset using `pandas`.

3. **Preprocessing Steps**  
   - **Filter Columns** based on input lists of features  
   - **Split Dataset** into training and testing sets  
   - **Handle Missing Values** using simple or KNN-based imputers  
   - **Outlier Handling** with Z-score filtering, IQR, or IsolationForest  
   - **Normality Testing** for deciding if transformation is needed  
   - **Categorical Encoding** (Ordinal, One-Hot, Frequency encoding, etc.)  
   - **Scaling** (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, or RobustScaler)  
   - **SMOTE/SMOTENC** to handle class imbalance

4. **Pipeline Construction**  
   Builds a scikit-learn `Pipeline` or `ColumnTransformer`, so transformations can be easily repeated.

5. **Saving and Loading Transformers**  
   Explains how to save preprocessing steps (`.pkl` files via `joblib`) for reuse during inference.

6. **Inverse Transformations**  
   Illustrates how to revert preprocessed features back to their original distribution, helping interpret model predictions.

7. **Examples**  
   Shows how the code might be adapted for classification, regression, or clustering tasks.

## How to Adapt for Your Own Project

1. **Update Feature Lists**  
   Change `ordinal_categoricals`, `nominal_categoricals`, and `numericals` to match your dataset.

2. **Set Model Category**  
   Pass `model_type="Your Model Description"` (e.g., `"Tree Based Classifier"`) to let `DataPreprocessor` guess classification vs. regression.

3. **Tune SMOTE and Scaling**  
   Configure `implement_smote` and `apply_scaling` options within the notebook to try different SMOTE variants or scaling methods.

4. **Extend the Notebook**  
   Add extra steps (e.g., advanced feature engineering, domain-specific transformations) as new cells or methods.

## Running This Example Notebook

1. **Activate Your Environment**  
   ```bash
   conda activate myenv   # or source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Launch Notebook**

   ```
   or  
   ```bash
