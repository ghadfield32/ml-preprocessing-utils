# DataPreprocessor

**DataPreprocessor** is a comprehensive Python package designed to streamline the data preprocessing workflow for various machine learning models. It offers functionalities such as handling missing values, outlier detection, feature encoding, scaling, and addressing class imbalances using techniques like SMOTE. 

**Datapreprocessor is for after feature engineering/multicollinearity checks/data retrieval, ensure you've done this if appropriate for the model type you are working with**

## üß∞ Features

- **Flexible Preprocessing Pipeline:** Customize preprocessing steps based on your model type and mode, default path for most Regressive/Classifier/Clustering models that can be adjusted
- **Automatic Outlier Detection:** Utilize methods like Z-Score Filtering, IQR Filtering, and Isolation Forest.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Support for Ordinal and One-Hot Encoding.
- **Scaling Options:** Apply StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, or RobustScaler.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Automated SMOTE/SMOTENC/SMOTEN handling. We have numerical + categorical datasets have SMOTENC applied, Categorical only has SMOTEN, and Numerical only goes through a criteria to use SMOTE/BorderlineSmote/ADSYN/SMOTEENN/SMOTETomek (these are optional also if you wanted to try a different one if you have a Numerical ONLY dataset)
- **Configuration Driven:** Easily adjust preprocessing steps via YAML configuration files.
- **Inverse Transformation:** Reconstruct original feature values from transformed data for interpretability.

## üöÄ Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ghadfield32/ml_preprocessor.git
    cd ml_preprocessor
    ```

2. **Install the Package:**

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

    Alternatively, for development purposes:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install Custom Preprocessing Package:**

    To include the custom preprocessing package directly from GitHub, use:

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/ghadfield32/ml_preprocessor.git
    ```

## üìù Usage

### Basic Train Example

```python
from datapreprocessor import DataPreprocessor
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')

# Initialize the DataPreprocessor
preprocessor = DataPreprocessor(
    model_type="Tree Based Classifier",
    y_variable=["target"],
    ordinal_categoricals=["ordinal_feature1", "ordinal_feature2"],
    nominal_categoricals=["nominal_feature1", "nominal_feature2"],
    numericals=["num_feature1", "num_feature2"],
    mode="train",
    # options=your_config_options,  # uncomment if custom scaling/encoding/transforming or want to adjust paths or anything
    debug=True
)

# Execute Preprocessing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, recommendations, X_test_inverse = preprocessor.final_preprocessing(
    df.drop('target', axis=1), 
    df['target']
)
```

### Train Preprocessing Adjustment Configuration

Customize preprocessing steps via the `preprocessor_config.yaml` file located in the `config/` directory. Adjust parameters like imputation strategies, encoding methods, scaling techniques, and SMOTE configurations based on your project needs.

### Running Preprocessing in Predict Mode

```python
from datapreprocessor import DataPreprocessor
import pandas as pd

# Load new data for prediction
new_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_new_data.csv')

# Initialize the DataPreprocessor in predict mode
preprocessor = DataPreprocessor(
    model_type="Tree Based Classifier",
    y_variable=["target"],
    ordinal_categoricals=["ordinal_feature1", "ordinal_feature2"],
    nominal_categoricals=["nominal_feature1", "nominal_feature2"],
    numericals=["num_feature1", "num_feature2"],
    mode="predict",
    # options=your_config_options,  # uncomment if custom scaling/encoding/transforming or want to adjust paths or anything
    debug=True
)

# Execute Preprocessing
X_preprocessed, recommendations, X_inversed = preprocessor.final_preprocessing(new_data)
```

### Predict Preprocessing Adjustment Configuration

Customize preprocessing steps via the `preprocessor_config.yaml`. Ensure that predict paths are same as training and if custom Scaling/Encoding/Transforming, then just point to the folder where those are located


### Running Preprocessing in Cluster Mode

```python
from datapreprocessor import DataPreprocessor
import pandas as pd

# Load new data for prediction
new_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_new_data.csv')

# Initialize the DataPreprocessor in predict mode
preprocessor = DataPreprocessor(
    model_type="Kmeans",
    y_variable=["target"],
    ordinal_categoricals=["ordinal_feature1", "ordinal_feature2"],
    nominal_categoricals=["nominal_feature1", "nominal_feature2"],
    numericals=["num_feature1", "num_feature2"],
    mode="cluster",
    # options=your_config_options,  # uncomment if custom scaling/encoding/transforming or want to adjust paths or anything
    debug=True
)

# Execute Preprocessing
X_preprocessed, recommendations = preprocessor.final_preprocessing(new_data)
```
## üß™ Testing

Run unit tests using `pytest` to ensure the package functions as expected:

```bash
pytest
```
